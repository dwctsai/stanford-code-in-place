## Section Slides

I am a Head TA for Code in Place 2025, where I lead a group of 100+ Section Leaders, each of whom teaches a weekly live section of 15 students over Zoom.

The program lasts 6 weeks and covers many topics in computer science and Python.  In the live sections, Section Leaders go over new concepts and work through hands-on exercises.

I created the slides in this repository for use in the weekly sections.
